# Project Name: Hash-Based Data Processor

## Description
This project implements a hash-based data processor designed to handle various text-based input files. The primary components include a hashing utility and a main driver program.

## Features
- Hashing functions defined in `hash.cpp` and `hash.h`.
- Processes multiple input datasets for analysis or demonstration.
- Modular structure for easy extensibility.

## Directory Structure
```
src/           - Contains source and header files.
inputs/        - Directory for sample input files.
Makefile       - Build instructions for compiling the project.
README.md      - Project description and usage.
```

## Getting Started
